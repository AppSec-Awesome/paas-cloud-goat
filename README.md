PaaS Cloud Goat is a simulated vulnerable Salesforce application providing hands-on experience with penetration testing of custom Salesforce applications.

The tool is similar to others like CloudGoat, CloudFoxable, AzureGoat, GCPGoat, and Pen-Testing Cloud REST APIs in OpenStack. It is not, however, a tool for attacking Salesforce.com itself.

It is novel because it focuses on custom applications deployed using the Salesforce platform and is the first tool to provide lab exercises with a collection of security tests. The main takeaways:
1. Hands-on learning opportunity of pen testing custom Salesforce applications
1. Detailed training documentation material about the underlying flaws
1. Consolidated list of common Salesforce application vulnerabilities
