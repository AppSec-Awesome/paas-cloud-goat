Select id,name from Contact

Observe that the "PRIVATE" contact is still not listed due to the "with sharing" restriction.

However, custom object like Building received the default configuration for sharing. The system mode made the difference.

Notice also in code review the alternative ways to specify the authorization permission mode:
    .isAccessible(), .isUpdateable(), .isCreateable(), .isDeletable()
